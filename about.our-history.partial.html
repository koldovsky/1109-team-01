        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <p>We are water experts in the United States.</p>
        <p>Sparkle started as a small spring water delivery business for a few neighborhoods when Tom Johnson, the founder, decided to filter spring water firstly for his family, then for family friends. It was just a small family company that delivered to different houses on the street. Things started to grow pretty fast though.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jonson bought the professional certified equipment and researched the best places with the cleanest water. Firstly these were just territories in the neighborhood and nearby; later they spread all over the States. Sparkle received an official FDA certification and got a license - that's where things became really serious.</p>
