            <p>We were using another water delivery company for a while but weren't quite satisfied with their services. When we found Sparkle, we felt the change right away. No order delays, prices are way better, and water's taste just awesome.

            <p>Finding a company that could deliver enough of clean spring water to our office was quite a pain in the neck for us. Sparkle had been a great exception â€” we loved it from the first sip! The water was really tasty!

            <p>Sparkle guys treat their job really responsibly. I know that many water delivery companies forget to deliver the order or don't get to the neighborhood in time. With Sparkle, we experienced nothing of that. The delivery was just on time.
